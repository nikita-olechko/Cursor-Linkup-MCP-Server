This document contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain.
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and transform data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks.
It has been particularly successful in tasks like:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing
